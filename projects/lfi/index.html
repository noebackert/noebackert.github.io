Generate an alert flag, triggering an alarm whenever an anomaly or fault condition is detected, thus preventing potential breaches or malfunctions in the chip. Operate by sensing transient currents within the CMOS structure, helping to maintain system integrity during fault conditions. BBICS play a critical role in securing integrated circuits against physical attacks, such as power-off laser fault injection. By ensuring that any suspicious activity is flagged, these sensors protect sensitive data and security mechanisms in embedded systems.\nBBICS are composed of a latch in the middle, and are surrounded by transistors connected to N-wells and P-wells on either side. When a transient current is detected in the bulk, the transistors trigger a change in the state of the latch, which raises an alert signal. This configuration ensures the detection of anomalies in both N-type and P-type regions, maintaining comprehensive fault detection coverage in the CMOS structure.\nSingle Event Effects Single Event Effects (SEEs) occur when an ionizing particle strikes a sensitive node within a semiconductor device, altering its state. This impact can lead to errors in digital circuits or transient faults in memory cells, known as Single Event Upsets (SEUs). According to NASA’s definition, SEEs are measurable effects on a circuit caused by ion impact. These effects include, but are not limited to:\nExample on a CMOS inverter:\nLayout Analysis (GDS File) of the Radhard Chip Since the chip we are working on is the result of research from the SAS laboratory, we have access to the layout files of the Radhard board (Radiation Hardening). This allows us to know where to direct our efforts. In our case, we will first focus on the single_BBICS located at the top of the board, and then on the Calisson_pattern_Well block, which is located at the bottom of the pattern_SC_TW_Well block and groups together the different BBICS with high sensitivity (hs_bbics) and low leakage (ll_bbics).\nBBICS Functionality Verification To verify the functionality of the BBICS, we first perform characterization at different laser energies and pulse widths.\nTo achieve this, we used the following experimental setup:\nThe camera provides real-time information on the laser’s position during the attack, allowing us to precisely target the desired BBICS with the help of the layout shown in the figure below.\nSummary of Characterization Parameters Here are the parameters used to characterize the operation of the BBICS. The table below lists the different ranges of the laser attack, the step size, the maximum current sent to the optical fiber, and the pulse width.\nTable 1: Characterization\nResults of the characterization Characterization on the Calisson_pattern_Well Block We also performed a characterization on the block containing the other BBICS, although these are not the ones we will attack first.\nWe can already observe two surprising results from these characterizations:\nOnly 4 flags are present (no fault, single NWell, high sensitivity PWell, and both at the same time). The high sensitivity BBICS seems to detect fault injections less sensitively than the single NWell BBICS. My mistake here was only performing one characterization. Indeed, the result does not seem to be consistent, and we cannot be sure of the proper functioning of the other BBICS. I should have run a characterization on another test card to compare the results.\nAttack protocol Several aspects need to be tested with different parameters to try to temporarily or permanently damage our integrated mass current sensor.\nFirst, the initial idea was to attack in order to exceed the TID (Total Ionizing Dose) of the targeted area. Indeed, when using a pulsed laser, it generates radiation effects that, at certain doses, can modify the behavior of the electronic circuit either temporarily or permanently. These radiation effects stem from the interactions between the laser and the sensor material, generating electron-hole pairs and inducing parasitic currents. As the accumulated radiation dose increases, these currents can alter the electrical characteristics of the components, leading to malfunctions. For example, a sufficient dose of radiation can cause a threshold voltage shift in transistors, an increase in leakage current, or a degradation of the overall performance of the circuit. These changes can result in temporary malfunctions, where the sensor can recover after a certain time, or permanent malfunctions where the damage is irreversible.\nNext, the second way to attack the integrated mass current sensor would be to use thermal effects associated with pulsed laser attacks, thus melting certain transistors during the attack.\nThe experimental protocol I devised for these two methods is as follows:\nInitial rough characterization (BBICS on) Turning off the board’s power supply Attack with energy/power P for X seconds and at a frequency F Powering the board Final rough characterization (BBICS on) These attacks will be performed using two different laser sources (nanosecond and picosecond) to test the different effects related to these sources.\nThe first targeted attacks we conducted on the BBICS were carried out on a different setup than the one used during the characterization (see Figure below). This setup uses the advanced laser from room E017, which has several interchangeable laser sources (nanosecond source, high-power nanosecond source: NanoHP, and a picosecond source).\nThis laser allowed us to carry out our experimental protocol with the greatest number of possible parameters (see tables below).\n","wordCount":"1026","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-07-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-07-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Noé Backert"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.noe.backert.fr/projects/lfi/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"My Personnal Blog - Noé Backert","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.noe.backert.fr/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script>window.MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"],["$","$"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]]},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre","code"]}}</script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js async></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.noe.backert.fr/ accesskey=h title="My Personnal Blog - Noé Backert (Alt + H)">My Personnal Blog - Noé Backert</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
