## Introduction

The goal of this project was to understand the basis of machine learning and deep learning. We compared the performance of different models for image prediction.

---

## Project Overview

This project encompasses:

- Comparing various models for image prediction  
- Training and testing these models  
- Evaluating their performance  
- Gaining hands-on experience  

---

## Project Description

Our project aimed to compare the performance of different models for image prediction. We used the CIFAR-3 dataset, which contains 18,000 32x32 RGB images in 3 different classes. The dataset is divided into 14,400 training images and 3,600 testing images.

## Models

We compared the performance of the following models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier  
- Deep Learning: MLP  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  

---

## Results

Our results showed that the CNN model outperformed the other models. It achieved an accuracy of 88% on the test set, while the MLP model achieved 75% accuracy. The logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes models achieved 60% and 61% accuracy, respectively.
