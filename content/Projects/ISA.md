## Introduction

Our Solidarity Engineer in Action Project is part of the ISI or Solidarity Engineer in Computer Science initiative, launched a few years ago by the Gardanne town hall to help reduce the digital divide, particularly among the elderly.

It consists of weekly training sessions taking place every Wednesday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. that we give to around twenty learners. Some signed up out of pure curiosity, others were driven by the simple desire to learn. Some learners also wanted to fill in their gaps (for those who already have a good foundation) and others want to start from scratch.  
In total, 23 learners signed up, some for their first year, others for their second or third year. The sessions began on Wednesday, March 15, 2023 and ended on June 17, 2023.

On June 21, a certification and medal award ceremony was held to crown the three months of training and all the effort made by the learners throughout this training.
