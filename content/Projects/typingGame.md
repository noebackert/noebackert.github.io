## Introduction

The goal of this project was to understand the basis of sockets, fork and threads in C programming.  
The project aims to design, simulate, and test a simple console game to work with threads and sockets.

---

## Project Overview

The project involves:  
- Understanding the concept of forks and threads  
- Understanding sockets and multiplayer management  
- Designing a Server-Client application  
- Using the GCC flags `-ansi -pedantic -Wall` to write standard-compliant code

## General Description of the Project

### Multiplayer Client/Server Typing Speed Game

- The player who types the most words correctly wins  
- **Originality:**  
  - Ability to start the game with a variable number of users (from 1 to `NB_CLIENT_MAX` players, as long as everyone is ready)  
  - Time management handled in a separate thread  
  - Score and ranking management with a variable number of clients

## Code Structure

To maintain clarity in digital system design projects, it is essential to separate source code from test benches and compiled files:

- **appli:** contains `client.c`, `serveur.c`, and `liste_francais.txt` (word list)  
- **include:** contains the headers of the modules  
- **modules:** contains the PSE modules used plus `words.c`  
- **lib:** contains `libpse.a`, the static library of the PSE modules

## Server

The server is the central element of the game. It manages the game, the players, and the game statistics.

## Client

The client is the player. It connects to the server and plays the game.
